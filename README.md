<strong>N-queens problem for 10000 queens for less than 3 sec :</strong>

The N queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard
so that no two queens threaten each other.
The solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

The solution is using min-conflict algorithm.
On every iteration we choose the queen with max-conflicts and place it on the position where it will be with min-conflicts.
If we have more than one possible chose for max-conflicted queen, 
or min-conflicted position we take randomly one of them.

Input:
At the beginning of the program we insert only the size of the problem.
